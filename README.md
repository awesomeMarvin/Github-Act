# Github-Act
#lib.py is an essential part of the whole code. It contains practically the code that makes it work. I made it myself, of course.

#So, make sure that it was imported properly before running GithubAct.

#Follow the following steps if unsure how:
#1. Download lib.py from the repository
#2. Open GithubAct in google colab
#3. Upload it to files.
#4. Run the code blocks of GithubAct 1 by 1
#5. Success!
